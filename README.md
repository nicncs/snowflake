## About Snowflake

Snowflake is Medium's tool for planning and supporting our engineers' career development. You can read more
about how we use this tool in our [growth framework documentation](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework).
Our growth tool is hosted [publicly](https://snowflake.medium.com).

## Contributions

You are free to use, change and build on this work to make it useful for your organisation. We will happily consider
unencumbered code contributions to improve functionality, but as this is the actual tool we use within Medium, acceptance is likely to be intentional, and deliberate. Meaning, slow. As such, you may prefer to fork the codebase for your own needs. We will not accept any contributions that modify the text of the application (but, thank you in advance for pointing out any typos).

### Future Work

* Add a reset to reset scores to 0, but keep name
* Add a link to copy URL to save name
* Save and retrieve individual states
